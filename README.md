# The Learning Portal

The Learning Portal is an education project that aims to build an educational landscape by facilitating seamless, efficient, and interactive communication between students and trainers. 

## This project

In this project, I am expected to build a Learn Portal, an online educational platform that connects trainers and students. This portal will be designed to:
- Register users
- Allow students to search and apply for courses
- Modify account details
- Enable trainers to review student requests and start the education process.

## Project Goal

The project's goal is to create a web application to consolidate knowledge and create a first portfolio project. The web application should work correctly on desktop computers, mobile phones, and tablets. 

## Main Screens/Pages

The end application will be based on five main screens/pages:
1. **Login**
2. **Home**
3. **My Account**
4. **Trainings**
5. **Join Us**
